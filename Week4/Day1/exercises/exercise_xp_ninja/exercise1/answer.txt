python can be called in any directory, because the PATH environment variable contains the "python" executable directory,
and searches that directory until it finds a "python" executable, then executes it in the current directory.
That's unless the PATH variable doesn't have the directory with the python executable.
export PATH="$PATH:<directory containing the python executable file>" will solve this on bash terminal.
